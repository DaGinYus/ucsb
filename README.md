# UCSB
Compilation of work done for classes at University of California, Santa Barbara

### lower-div
This was work for lower division lab classes. They are Jupyter notebook files converted to .py scripts.

### phys134L
This was a lab class on observational astrophysics. There is a mix of Jupyter notebook files as well as my final project. We covered various topics such as
astronomical coordinate systems, photometry, data reduction, and stellar life cycles. For the final project, I chose to work on an exoplanet transit.

### phys129L
This was a lab class on computational methods for physics. We covered the shell and UNIX system briefly before moving on to various data processing techniques, networking, and numerical methods like Monte Carlo methods. Some highlights include a triangle drawing file, located in the hw5 folder.
